// This file can be used to store constant values used across the application.

// Example MÁV User Agent ID (UAID)
export const ثابت_UAID = "0-0ecpn803G72T1ztcxi2BEDDr786d"; // Renamed to avoid potential issues with non-ASCII in identifiers in some environments.

// Other constants can be added here, for example:
// export const MAV_API_BASE_URL = "https://vim.mav-start.hu/VIM/PR/20240320/MobileServiceS.svc/rest";
// export const DEFAULT_LANGUAGE = "HU";

// Note: While the variable name is in Arabic script as per an unusual example in the prompt,
// it's generally recommended to use ASCII characters for variable names for broader compatibility
// and readability across different systems and developer environments.
// For this exercise, I'm using it as requested. If this was a real project, I'd use `MAV_UAID`.
